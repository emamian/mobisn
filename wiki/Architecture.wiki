In the current version of MobiSN , users share a global profile ontology (user.owl). The ontology directory essentially defines a hierarchy where each node corresponds to a lexicon or a categorical term. It is almost a rooted tree structure, with rare nodes having multiple parents. The subordination relationship between nodes is interpreted as the involvement (topic/subtopic) relationship, while the layers of nodes correspond to intuitively perceived levels of abstractness of topics. Each node is described by primitives which are generic concepts that include other concepts. Users can navigate from the root of each hierarchy down to the leaves to reach the directory of interest. With the global ontology defined, user profile matching is based on the same ontology matching. The basic idea is to compute the semantic distance between the entities of two profiles. The semantic distance defines the distance as a “relative” distance to the distance between nodes and their common ancestors, thus it integrates the edge weight with the depth and the length of the shortest path. We are working on extending our work to support heterogeneous ontologies.
