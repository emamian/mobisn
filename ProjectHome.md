**MobiSN** is a software package for cellular phones to form mobile ad hoc social networks, which are self-configuring social networks that connect users using mobile devices, such as laptops, PDAs, and cellular phones. These social networks facilitate users to form virtual communities of similar interests or commonalities. MobiSN is implemented in **Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME)**. J2MEâ€™s Bluetooth API (JSR 82) is used for Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones. It implements all of the core features of a mobile ad hoc social networking, including: profile generating, friend matchmaking, routing control. We also implemented the ad hoc multi-hop text messaging and file sharing as part of the service pack for MobiSN.
